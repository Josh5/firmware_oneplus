# Commands Explained

**Explanation of the command:**
***
**./extract.sh** - since the terminal is in this directory already, the ./ prefix indicates we're executing this file.
***
**oneplus5** - The device I'm going to flash**
***
**/home/angela/Downloads/OnePlus5Oxygen_23_OTA_048_all_123456.zip** - The image I downloaded from Oneplus of OxygenOS is in my `/home/angela/Downloads` folder and the filename is `OnePlus5Oxygen_23_OTA_048_all_123456.zip` (you can also rename the .zip to be shorter)
***
**out/oneplus_5/oneplus_5_oxygenos_9.0.5_firmware.zip** - `out/` is the directory where the flashable zip is going to go, `oneplus_5_oxygenos_9.0.5_firmware.zip` is going to be the filename of the zip.
